# Post-build release helper (local publish flow, mirrors the v3.9.x layout).

# electron-builder emits space-named artifacts ("Noctra Client-*") and yml feeds
# that reference them. This script, for the current package.json version:
#   1. makes URL-safe hyphenated copies ("Noctra-Client-*"),
#   2. rewrites latest.yml / latest-linux.yml to point at the hyphenated names,
#   3. uploads to every target repo both the space-named originals (GitHub stores
#      them as "Noctra.Client-*") and the hyphenated copies plus the two ymls,
#      producing the established 12-asset set per release.
#
# Requires: gh (authed, repo scope). Drafts must already exist (ensure-release.js).
